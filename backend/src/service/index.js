Their service department has taken care of me exceptionally several times, especially Patrick Evans!  He is so friendly and so knowledgeable.  I had a small wreck in my 2018 Chevy Traverse that I purchased from McKaig, and Patrick recommended Adrian Cortes to sell me a new vehicle on the spot instead of fixing my Traverse and I took the bait willingly!  LOL !!!  I knew that Adrian would put me in a reliable vehicle that would fit my needs, including 4-wheel drive, having to fit a 6’4” man in the front passenger seat and 2 big car seats in the back, not to mention TONS of room in the back for all my junk and groceries.  Needless to say, Adrian  fixed me up in a 2018 4x4 Jeep Grand Cherokee that is loaded to the max and is WAY sportier and more luxurious than what I had before.  I told Adrian what I wanted in a vehicle and he took me right to it, where I immediately fell in love with the All-Black look, even the 20” wheels.  I feel like a Cool Mom now thanks to Adrian!  I will DEFINITELY purchase my next vehicle from him!  I couldn’t be happier!',

You can imagine my anxiety at that point.  The staff at McKaig was friendly, helpful and reassuring. I left the car there since it was Friday afternoon.

He was super patient with all mi kids and being with us until 10pm! We are from Henderson, TX and definitely was worth the drive! I appreciate the help we got from Dennis, McCloskey, and  Prickett. They made our purchase so smoothly. I highly recommend them to my family and friends.',

        comment_text: 'This is my second time coming in and my husband’s fourth time and between any other dealership we’ve been to this is the best one yet. McKaig works with you good credit or bad and will help you based off of income. After coming here so many times between both me and my husband we have recommended it to friends and family and I know they have never been disappointed either. They keep working with you until the expectations you have for a vehicle is met and they are very honest people. We will definitely be coming here again in the future.',
